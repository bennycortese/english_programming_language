# Introduction
Boost coding with English Programming Language - speak instead of typing. EPL translates spoken English into 3 code variants, freeing you from the syntax hassle, empowering you to make apps with ease.

### Inspiration
We were inspired to create English Programming Language to revolutionize the way people code and make it accessible to everyone.

### What it does
English Programming Language allows users to speak into a microphone, which is powered by calls translate spoken English into three code variants, freeing users from the hassle of learning syntax and enabling them to focus on their ideas.

### How we built it
We built English Programming Language by leveraging cutting-edge technologies, using ChatGPT API calls to translate spoken English into code variants.

### Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was integrating Modal to seamlessly to deliver a smooth user experience. Additionally, we had to ensure that our technology accurately translated spoken English into code, which required a lot of testing and fine-tuning.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud to have created a tool that empowers people to create complex programs and applications with ease, regardless of their coding experience. We're also proud of the accessibility our technology which provides a robust alternative to vision-impaired people who can use the mic instead of the keyboard.

### What we learned
Building English Programming Language taught us a lot about the power of AI and how it can be used to simplify complex tasks. We also learned a lot about the challenges involved in integrating multiple technologies and making them work seamlessly together.

### What's next for English Programming Language
We're constantly working to improve the accuracy and efficiency of our technology, and we plan to integrate Codex to store previous request/response logs in the future. We also hope to continue making coding more accessible to everyone by adding more features and expanding our user base.
